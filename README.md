# CSS Wrangler
A very old idea I decided to rekindle and take from it's current, loosely working version into something (we) can enjoy and be proud of.

## Dev Setup
1. csswrangler.dev (point it at the root folder)
2. static.csswrangler.dev (point it at the 'static' folder)

## Usage
1. Go to [http://csswrangler.dev](http://csswrangler.dev)
2. Drag the link into your bookmarks.
3. Have fun.
